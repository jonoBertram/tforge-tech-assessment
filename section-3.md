# Section 3: Full-stack development

### Question 1

> Detail your experience in full-stack web development, including how you integrate frontend and backend technologies to create cohesive applications.

I am a well-versed full-stack developer, having built and maintained both front- and back-end parts of various projects for Yoco. These projects have involved a React and Gatsby / NextJS frontend using Gatsby's built-in graphql compatibility for queries or NextJS's `/api/` routing with native Javascript `fetch`.

This has always been accompanied by a Python-built API and Django database management interface alongside graphene for graphql queries and data manipulation.

Front and backend projects have always been maintained as separate repositories in my experience.

### Question 2

> Provide examples of projects where you've worked on both frontend and backend components.

The [Yoco Reseller](https://reseller.yoco.com/) project is a perfect example of one where I have contributed both to the back and front-end codebases. The same goes for the [Yoco](https://www.yoco.com/za/shop/card-machines/) products purchasing and checkout processes that integrate with a product back-end.
