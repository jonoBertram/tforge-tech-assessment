# Section 4: Project Management and Collaboration

### Question 1

> How do you utilize tools like Figma, Notion, Jira, and GitHub for project management and collaboration within a team?

Project management and collaboration tools like the ones mentioned are an integral part of my day-to-day working routine. I interface with our designs and wireframes via Figma and use its built-in commenting feature or Slack to communicate with my team and the designers on anything that needs to be cleared up. We have also worked with Miro and Sketch design tools before as well when collaborating with external designers.

We use Notion Kanban boards and tables to organise tasks by their current development progress and have also used Jira and Trello before to the same effect.

Internal company text and voice communications generally happen on a dedicated Discord server or via email. I have also made use of VS Code's Live Share feature for remote peer programming since most of my work is done remotely.

### Question 2

> Describe a challenging project management situation you've faced and how you resolved it.

As my current team's project grew bigger, we ended up with bloated Kanban boards for different types of tasks (features, bug fixes, and technical debt). These boards became confusing to maintain as some tasks ended up going stale and getting stuck in the "blocked" column for far too long.

A solution that a colleague and I implemented was to write a custom script to rank cards in each column based on how stale they are and show an alert at the bottom of each card to tell us how old the card is. For example, a card that had not been edited in 12 days, would be pushed to the top of the column with the message "Stale for 12 days!" in red text at the bottom. This card would then be ranked higher than a card only stale for 5 days, for example.
