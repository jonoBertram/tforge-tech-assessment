# Section 5: UI/UX Design

### Question 1

> Discuss your experience with UI/UX design principles and tools such as Adobe XD and Figma.

My professional experience with UI/UX principles is limited to certain projects in my portfolio such as the [Colab](https://wearecolab.com/) and [John Soderlund guitars](https://jgsguitars.com/) projects. In both of these, I was involved in iterative wireframing followed by higher fidelity designs that were built mobile-first to be fully responsive. Most of my experience has been in working with Adobe XD when taking on UI design work but I have some experience in this field in Figma as well.

### Question 2

> Provide examples of projects where you've incorporated UI/UX design considerations into your development process.

In the [Colab](https://wearecolab.com/) project, we found in early user testing that some of the call-to-action button colours where not drawing as much attention to certain interactive elements and so, reconsidered and darkened some of the colours (the olive green colour, for example) to make these primary call-to-actions stand out more against the clean and often sparse cards and sections.
